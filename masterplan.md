| **Mocked Backend**       | Node.js/Express or Flask + mock DB (JSON/SQLite/PostgreSQL)   | Fast setup for storing user profiles, orders, etc.                |
| **Ticketing Logic**      | Simulated DB collection + UI render                           | Represents ticket creation and status                             |

### 🧹 Conceptual Data Model (Mocked)

```
UserProfile {
  user_id
  name
  preferred_language
  recent_orders[]
  past_issues[]
}

Order {
  order_id
  user_id
  product_name
  status
  expected_delivery
}

ChatLog {
  chat_id
  user_id
  messages[]
  resolution_status
  escalated (bool)
}

Ticket {
  ticket_id
  user_id
  issue_summary
  timestamp
  status
}
```

---

### 🎨 User Interface Principles

- **Clean, WhatsApp-inspired layout**: chat bubbles, avatars, timestamps.
- **Quick-reply buttons** for common actions.
- **Typing indicators** to simulate real-time response.
- **Customer context header** (e.g., recent orders).
- **Chat footer** with escalation/ticket confirmation messages.

---

### 🔐 Security Considerations

Since this is a mock/demo product:

- No sensitive real user data is handled.
- Still practice **basic form validation** and **XSS protection** in chat inputs.
- If expanded, ensure:
  - Proper **authentication layer** (OAuth or JWT)
  - **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
  - **Data encryption** at rest and in transit
