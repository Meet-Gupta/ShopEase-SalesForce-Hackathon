# ShopEase AI Customer Support Chatbot - System Design

## Implementation Approach

After analyzing the ShopEase AI Customer Support Chatbot requirements, we will implement a web-based AI chat interface with the following approach:

### Technology Stack Selection

- **Frontend**: React.js with TailwindCSS for a responsive, WhatsApp-inspired UI that supports real-time updates, perfect for chat interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for a lightweight server that can handle chat sessions and API integrations.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user profiles, orders, chat logs, and tickets with flexibility for future expansion.
- **AI/NLP Layer**: Integration with OpenAI GPT API for natural language understanding and generation, with context management.
- **Multilingual Support**: Translation layer using Google Translate API to support multiple languages.
- **State Management**: Redux for managing application state and WebSockets for real-time communication.
- **Analytics**: Chart.js for visualizing key performance metrics in dashboards.

### Key Implementation Challenges and Solutions

1. **AI Context Management**:
   - We'll implement a context manager that maintains conversation history and user data to provide personalized responses.
   - Use prompt engineering techniques to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy.

2. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Implement language detection at the beginning of conversations.
   - Create a translation middleware layer between user input, AI processing, and response generation.

3. **Escalation Logic**:
   - Develop confidence scoring for AI responses.
   - Create keyword and pattern recognition for detecting escalation triggers.
   - Build a summary generator for creating concise issue descriptions for human agents.

4. **Analytics Engine**:
   - Create a structured logging system to capture interaction metrics.
   - Implement aggregation pipelines for generating insights from chat data.

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The system will be structured using the following key classes and their relationships:

1. **User Management**: Handle user profiles and authentication.
2. **Chat System**: Manage conversations between users and the AI.
3. **AI Service**: Process natural language, generate responses, and manage context.
4. **Escalation System**: Manage ticket creation and escalation to human agents.
5. **Analytics Engine**: Generate insights from chat data.
6. **Database Interface**: Handle data persistence across the application.

Detailed class diagrams are provided in the shopease_ai_chatbot_class_diagram.mermaid file.

## Program Call Flow

The system works through several key flows:

1. **Chat Initialization Flow**: User starts a chat session, language is detected/selected, and user data is retrieved.
2. **Query Processing Flow**: User query is processed, understood, and responded to by the AI.
3. **Escalation Flow**: Complex issues are escalated to simulated human agents with context summaries.
4. **Analytics Generation Flow**: Chat data is processed to generate insights for the dashboard.

Detailed sequence diagrams are provided in the shopease_ai_chatbot_sequence_diagram.mermaid file.

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Real-time Requirements**: The document doesn't specify exact response time requirements. Assuming sub-second response times for a smooth chat experience.

2. **Data Retention Policy**: No information provided about how long chat logs, user data, and generated insights should be stored. Implementing standard 90-day retention with options to configure.

3. **Scale Requirements**: No specific user load is mentioned. The design assumes moderate traffic with ability to scale horizontally.

4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Will implement comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation (e.g., if AI service is down, fall back to basic FAQ responses or direct human escalation).

5. **Deployment Environment**: No specific deployment environment is specified. The design assumes cloud deployment with containerization for portability.
